## Brief:

PyToDo – A python task manager is a feature that provides details about your daily schedule i.e. processes running in your daily life. It has features such as:

1.	Adding date and time as a reminder (The feature will help to remember the task.)
2.	Alarm Notification.
3.	Sending a whatsapp notification/message (To your mobile regarding your pending task and consists of a feature) 

**Date-Time Input**
>Calendar pickers are control elements that display a full calendar month at one time. Calendar pickers should be used for events close to the present time — within less than a year. However, they can be frustrating for users who choose dates far in advance because they require too much navigation to get to the desired input; for these users, it would be faster to simply type the year.

**Alarm Notification**
>An alarm triggered notification to notify users when an alarm condition is met. Notifications are used for notifying users or user groups that a certain alarm or other event, such as a schedule or an application condition, has occurred in the system. 

**Twilio API for WhatsApp**
>WhatsApp is the most popular OTT app in many parts of the world. With the Twilio API for whatsApp, you can reach more than 1.5 billion whatsapp users with a simple REST API, which is part of Twilio’s Programmable Messaging platform. You can send notifications, have two-way conversations, or build chat bots. If you're trying to reach – and better converse with – users in LATAM, EMEA, and APAC, you need to consider using whatsapp.
